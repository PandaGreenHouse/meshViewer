"#meshViewer for geodesic distance" 
This project contains some features to construct triangle mesh from unorganized mesh.
It contains some features to display mesh, heat diffusion and geodesic distance strips.
Features contains computations of Laplasian, heat gradiant and geodesic distance.
I want some collaborate work with other contributors. contact info:ppeng0674@gmail.com, skype id:live:.cid.f16fc3e293877b4e
